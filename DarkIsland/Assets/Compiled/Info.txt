This is where the compiled assets from AssetsProject and AssetsProjectModels

I did it this way becuase I noticed that projects can compile in parralel and assets seem to compile with a wierd delay

So It builds faster. The only problem is after compiling the first time you get errors because the assests did not compile. 

Build after those errors and its sorted.
